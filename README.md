Option 1: Heroes of Pymoli

    This a free-to-play fantasy game where players are encouraged to purchase optional items to enhance their playing experience. Please see the game's purchasing data report below. 

    Player Count: There is a current count of 576 total number of Heroes of Pymoli players. There is a higher male player count (84.03%) demographic than female gender count players (14.06%). A small (1.91%) percentage chose the "Other / Non-Disclosed" option. 

    Purchasing Analysis: There are currently 179 unique items that Pymoli players have purchased. These unique items' average price comes in at $3.05 per item, with 780 individual purchases and a generated total revenue of $2,379.77. Male players have made 652 purchases (Avg. $3.02/item), while female players have only made 113 purchases (Avg. $3.20/item). However, Female players are averaging a higher "Purchase per Person" ($4.47) than Male players ($4.07). 

    Age Demographics Analysis: Existing players are primarily composed of the 20-24 years age group (44.79%). The 20-24 year age group is the only group above 20% and is double the size of any other Pymoli player age group. The 15-19 years age group comes in second (18.58%), the 25-29 years age group comes in third (13.37%), while the 40+ years age group comes in last (2.08%). With no surprises, the 20-24 years age group has also purchased the most in-app unique items (365 purchase count) and has generated $1,114.06 in Total Purchase Value. 

    Most Popular Item Analysis: Currently, the two most popular and profitable items in Heroes of Pymoli are items (92: Final Critic & 178: Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm). Both these items have generated over ten individual sales each. 

    Recommendations: I would highly recommend for more advertisements for the 20-24 age group and more in-app item purchase opportunities.
